				<h2>Disclosure Statements</h2>
				
				<p>In accordance with the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical
				Education’s Standards for
				Commercial Support and the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education’s
				Guidelines for
				Standards for Commercial Support, ASHP Advantage requires that all
				individuals involved in the
				development of activity content disclose their relevant financial
				relationships. A person has a relevant
				financial relationship if the individual or his or her spouse/partner has a
				financial relationship (e.g.,
				employee, consultant, research grant recipient, speakers bureau, or
				stockholder) in any amount
				occurring in the last 12 months with a commercial interest whose products
				or services may be
				discussed in the activity content over which the individual has control.
				The existence of these
				relationships is provided for the information of participants and should
				not be assumed to have an
				adverse impact on presentations.</p>

				<p>All faculty and planners for ASHP Advantage education activities are
				qualified and selected by ASHP
				Advantage and required to disclose any relevant financial relationships
				with commercial interests.
				ASHP Advantage identifies and resolves conflicts of interest prior to an
				individual’s participation in
				development of content for an educational activity.</p>
